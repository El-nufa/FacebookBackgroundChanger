Directly dragging a picture from another website will not work. \r\n###Download from the Internet\r\nIn the upper-right hand corner in the options page, click on \"Picture from URL\". Then, enter the address of the picture you want to have as your background in the text field (note - should end with .jpg, .png, or another image format). Click on \"Retrieve Image\" then \"Save\" if you want to set the picture as your backgroud.\r\n\r\n#Background Sharing\r\nGo to the options page and use the buttons under the title \"Background Mode\".\r\n### Private Mode\r\nYour current background will only be visible to you and it will not be uploaded to our servers.  This is the default mode for new users.\r\n### Public Mode\r\nAnyone viewing your profile who has the extension installed will see your background.\r\n#Transparency\r\nTo control how much you can see through Facebook pages, so you can see your background, use the \"Page Opacity\" setting on the options page. Moving the slider to the right makes the page less transparent and moving it to the left makes the page more transparent.\r\n\r\n#Premium Backgrounds\r\nPremium backgrounds can be purchased from inside the options page. All purchased backgrounds are linked to the Google account that you sign into. If you switch computers, your purchased backgrounds go with you. To verify which account you are signed into, check your name in the top right corner of the options page (You can also sign in and out to verify it).\r\nImportant - The account that you purchase the background is not the account the background is saved to, the one that you sign in using the link in the upper-right hand corner is.","name":"Facebook Background Changer","tagline":"Welcome to the Documentation for the Facebook Background Changer."}
