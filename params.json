This is the default mode for new users.\r\n### Public Mode\r\nAnyone viewing your profile who has the extension installed will see your background.\r\n#Transparency\r\nTo control how much you can see through Facebook pages, so you can see your background, use the \"Page Opacity\" setting on the options page.
